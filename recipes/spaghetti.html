    <h2>How To Make the Best Spaghetti</h2>
    <p>Trust me, this is the best spaghetti you will ever have</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>Spaghetti
        <li>Salt and pepper
        <li>Basil leaves</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions).</li>
